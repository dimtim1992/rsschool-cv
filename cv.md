## About
My main goal is to get necessary skills for work as a junior frontend developer.

My strengths are learning propensity, systems approach and data analytics. I also do technical work quickly.

At the moment I have no real experience in this field, but I strive to acquire the necessary skills for this.
***
## Skills
HTML5, CSS3, Github

I have experience in developing projects using Agile and Waterfall methodologies.

## Code example from Codewars:
### Task

In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

### Solution:
```
function filter_list(l) {
  return l.filter(function(i) {
    return typeof (i) !== "string";
  });

```
